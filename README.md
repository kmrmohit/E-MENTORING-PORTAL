# E-Mentoring Portal
# WHAT?
this portal is about the students interacting with their mentors online. The students will be able to post their queries and in response they will be getting answers from the mentors. Each student will be assigned a mentor. Each mentor will be available to their assigned students though the students can also post their questions in the public forum where they can expect answers from anybody having knowledge of the same.

# WHY?
today very few students find the classrooms interactive and they are more busy online and hence they don't pay attention to classroom teaching. So later on, they may find it difficult to understand some of the topics and at that point of time, instead of looking for resources, they can directly post their doubts on the forum and get it resolved by their friends or the mentors.

# HOW?
this project has been fully implemented in python using flask as the web-framework and MySql database.
